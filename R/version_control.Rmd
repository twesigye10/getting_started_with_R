# Version control with Git, GitHub, Sourcetree and RStudio

Version control involves managing the versions of our code. We can track changes 
we made to the code and in this way we could even reset the code to a desired backward version of the code. 

There are many ways of using `R Studio`, `Git` and `GitHub`. But for the purpose of this guide, we shall focus on setting up environment for version control using `Git`, `Github` and `Sourcetree`.

## Git, GitHub

`Git` is is a free and open source distributed version control mechanism that we can use to manage our code. `GitHub` on the other hand is a an internet hosting service for projects using git as their version control mechanism. By default the projects hosted are public and can be accessed by anyone. However there are also private projects.

### Installing Git

We can [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install on our computers. During the installation, it will install also with it `Git Bash` and `Git GUI` (Graphical User Interface).
These two interfaces can be used to manage the code with the `Git Bash` using command line interface while the GUI using a user interface to manage the code. For the purpose of this guidance, we shall be using `Sourcetree` that is an easy to use tool.

## Accessing GitHub

We can use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store and manage our code. To use it for this purpose, we need to create an account if we do not have one already. You can sign up from the [GitHub sign up](https://github.com/signup) page.


## Sourcetree

`Sourcetree` is a free Git client from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) that simplifies working with Git repositories. You can easily manage and visualize your code.

You can [download Sourcetree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree) from the software page of `Atlassian` and install it on your computer.

## Configure Sourcetree and Github

After the installation of `Git`, `Sourcetree` and creating a `GitHub` account, we can now configure our tools to easily manage the versions of our code.

### Enable version control in R Studio

To enable version control in `R Studio`, open `R Studio` then click on `Tools` menu select `Global Options`, then `Git/SVN` and activate the `Enable Version control interface for R Studio projects`. The `Git executable` box should now be filled with the location of `Git` executable file.

### Add GitHub account to Sourcetree

To connect GitHub account to Sourcetree, under `Remote Repositories` tab in Sourcetree, click on `Add an accountâ€¦` and edit the information in the `Edit Hosting Account` menu that pops up. 

For `Hosting Service`, choose `GitHub`. 

For `Authentication`, choose `OAuth` and click `Refresh OAuth Token`. This may open a web page for you to sign in to `GitHub`.  

Once signed in, the account connection will display under the `Remote Repositories` tab. If you click on your account and the click on `refresh` button, you will see your repositories on `GitHub`.
