## Setting up the environment

### why R

R is a scripting language known for its simple syntax.
It is suitable for anyone desiring start or enhance their journey in
data management, analysis and scientific research. It can be used to
retrieve data, clean, analyse and visualize the data.

- Simple syntax
- Variety of packages to handle wide range of tasks
- Powerful RStudio IDE for simplify code management and getting started
- Also R has a large community of users and you will easily get support

### Installing R and RStudio

Before we start coding, we need to setup the coding environment. 
We shall install R and RStudio the graphical Integrated Development Environment (**IDE**) for R.
RStudio makes using R much easier and more interactive.

### Installing R

**[Download the R installation file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)**.

Run the downloaded file and accept prompts to install.

**[Download the RStudio installation file](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)**.

Run the downloaded file and accept prompts as well.

### RStudio Interface

RStudio is divided into 4 panels

- Source (top-left)
- R Console (top-right)
- Environment/History (top-right)
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (bottom-right)

### Interacting with RStudio

#### a) Using the RStudio console

We can use RStudio console to give commands to R on what it should do.

write the line below in the console and hit enter

```{r}
print("Hello world")
```

simple calculations

```{r}
1 + 5
```

#### b) Creating script files

We can create new scripts and put our commands that R should perform.

Follow the steps shown in the figure to create a new file.

![](../img/new_file.png)
Let us now add the previous code into the script and save the script.

```{r}
print("Hello world")

# This is a comment
# simple calculations
1 + 5
```

### Variable assignment

We use **`<-`** symbol to assign objects to variables. 

This symbol has the followig shortcut on windows computers **`alt + -`**

```{r}
# assigning
greeting <- "Hello"

print(greeting)

# joining strings
my_name <- "John"
greeting_2 <- paste(greeting, ":", my_name)

print(greeting_2)

```


## Data structures and types

### Data types

Variables can store data of different data types.
In R, the data type of the R-object becomes the data type of the variable.

- **numeric** - (6.5, 71, 217)
- **integer** - (1L, 33L, 301L, "L" declares this as an integer)
- **complex** - (9 + 3i, where "i" is the imaginary part)
- **character (a.k.a. string)**  - ("m",  "TRUE", "Getting started with R", "FALSE", "23.1")
- **logical (a.k.a. boolean)**  - (TRUE or FALSE)

The **`class()`** function is used to check the data type of a variable

```{r}
greeting <- "Hello"
class(greeting)

my_data <- c("m",  "TRUE", "Getting started with R", "FALSE", "23.1")

class(my_data)
```


### Vectors

A vector is a common data type in R and is composed of a series of values that are of the same data type. Either numbers or characters or logical.

We create a vector using the **`c()`** function and seperate the items using a comma.

```{r}
# Create a vector.
fisher_men <- c('Peter', 'Andrew','James',"John") # character vector
print(fisher_men)

# Get the class of our vector.
print(class(fisher_men))

vector_num <- c(11, 101, 23, 50.3) # numeric vector 
class_vec_num <- class(vector_num)

vector_log <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE) # logical vector
class_vec_log <- class(vector_log)

print(paste("The class of vector_num is: ", class_vec_num))
print(paste("The class of vector_log is: ", class_vec_log))

```

#### Subsetting vectors

To access elements of a vector, we use indices. The index of the first element in a vector is **1**, the second is **2** ...

We provide the index in square brackets to retrieve the desired element from the vector.

```{r}

fisher_men <- c('Peter', 'Andrew','James',"John") # character vector

# first element
fisher_men[1]

# last element
fisher_men[length(fisher_men)]

# particular elements
fisher_men[fisher_men %in% c("John", "Andrew")]

vector_num <- c(11, 101, 23, 50.3) # numeric vector 

# first element
vector_num[1]

# last element
vector_num[length(vector_num)]

# particular elements
vector_num[vector_num > 15]

```

#### Repeat vectors

Repeat vectors using the **`rep()`** function

```{r}
# each
rep(c('Peter', 'Andrew','James',"John"), each = 5)

# times
rep(c('Peter', 'Andrew','James',"John"), times = 5)

rep(c('Peter', 'Andrew','James',"John"), times = c(4, 2, 3, 1))

```

#### Sequenced vectors
Use the **`:`** symbol or **`seq()`** function to create a vector of sequencies.
```{r}
# using ':'
1:20

# using 'seq()'
seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 1)

seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 4)

seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 5)

```


### lists

### Dataframes


```{r }

```

## Functions

what are functions

building up on paste()

creating functions for repetitive tasks

```{r }

```

## Useful functions for data mgt

reading and writing files,
select,
mutate, 
filter, 
group_by,
summarise

```{r }

```

## Creating reports in R


```{r }

```
